Quick and dirty, Linux-only GLSL syntax checker for Syntastic [1]. It uses
the local GL driver to check for errors in shaders. It can be used for both
'normal' shaders and separable shaders. It requires OpenGL 3.0 in the former
case, and ARB_separate_shader_objects in the latter.

A shader's source file must contain a line that reads:
	// type: X
where X is one of the following:
	v	Vertex shader
	f	Fragment shader
	g	Geometry shader
	tc	Tessellation control shader
	te	Tessellation evaluation shader
	c	Compute shader

If you want a shader to be checked as a separable shader, you'll need to add
this line:
	// separable: yes

Also, you probably need to add
	let g:syntastic_glsl_checkers = [ 'driver' ]
somewhere in your Vim configuration.

For NeoBundle, this should work:
	NeoBundle 'tseeker/syntastic-glsl-drv' , {
		\ 'build' : {
		\     'linux' : 'make'
		\    },
		\ }
